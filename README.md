## Usage

Day and Part is obtained from environment variables so you can do

```
day=1 part=1 npm run build && npm start
```

If you don't want to specify day and part every time you run,
you can run below command to set day and part for current session.

```
export day=1 part=1
```

This will set the enviornment varibles for the session so you can just run `npm run build` and then `npm start`
